Here's a brief overview of what I learned and accomplished:

ðŸ“Š Data Exploration & Preprocessing: Explored the dataset, checked for missing values, and visualized the distribution of features such as age, annual income, and spending score.

ðŸ”§ Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering: Preprocessed the data, scaled the features, and engineered relevant features to enhance clustering performance.

ðŸŽ¯ K-Means Clustering: Applied the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers into clusters based on their spending behavior, determining the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method.

ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation & Interpretation: Evaluated the quality of clusters using metrics such as silhouette score, inertia, and Davies-Bouldin index. Interpreted the results to understand the characteristics of each customer segment.

ðŸ’¡ Insights & Reflections: Learned valuable insights about customer segmentation and its importance in targeting marketing efforts and improving customer satisfaction. This project highlighted the power of data-driven approaches in understanding customer behavior and driving business decisions.
